Limitations
===========

    Radar is new tool so it's far from being perfect. Here are some things that
    you should know about the current status of the tool.

    * Concurrent checks. Radar does not support concurrent checks at the moment.

    * Concurrent plugin execution : At the moment all plugins are executed
      sequentially, this is in a way identical to the checks limitation described
      above.

    * Passive checks : There's no passive checking support yet. This feature will
      certainly be implemented in the near future.

    * SNMP checks : SNMP is not supported. It hasn't been yet defined if this
      feature will be supported.


    All described limitations are intended to be implemented in the future.
