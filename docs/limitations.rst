Limitations
===========

    Radar is a brand new project and here are some things that you should know
    about the current status of the tool :

    * Concurrent checks : Radar does not support concurrent checks at the moment.

    * Concurrent plugin execution : At the moment all plugins are executed
      sequentially, this is in a way identical to the checks limitation described
      above.

    * Passive checks : There's no passive checking support yet. This feature will
      certainly be implemented in the near future.

    * SNMP checks : SNMP is not supported. It hasn't been yet defined if this
      feature will be supported at all.

    * SSL/TLS : Not yet supported but certainly it's going to be included on
      a future release.


    All described limitations are intended to be implemented in the future.
