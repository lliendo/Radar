Welcome to Radar !
==================

Radar is a simple and easy to use monitoring tool designed with flexibility
and extensibility in mind. 

It mainly aims for ease of use, all configuration is handled
through YAML files and nearly all options are set by default.
A typical installation runs out of the box with minimum intervention.

What Radar is capable to monitor is really up to you. You can write
checks in your favourite programming language to monitor anything
that you're interested in.
