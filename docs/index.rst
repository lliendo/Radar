Welcome to Radar !
==================

    Radar is a simple and easy to use monitoring tool designed with flexibility
    and extendability in mind. 
    
    It mainly aims to be an easy to use tool, all configuration is handled
    through YAML files and almost all options are set by default for you,
    this means that a typical installation runs out of the box with
    minimum intervention.
    
    What Radar is capable to monitor is really up to you. You can write
    checks in your favourite programming language to monitor anything
    that you're interested in.
