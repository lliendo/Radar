Minimum requiremients
---------------------

    In order to run, Radar needs the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ interpreter (at least
    version 2.7) and a few dependencies (`Nose <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ and `PyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/>`_). These
    dependencies are already defined in the code, so you don't need
    to install them manually.

    Here is a list of currently supported OSes :

        * GNU/Linux.
        * FreeBSD.
        * NetBSD.
        * OpenBSD.
        * Darwin / Mac OS X.
        * Microsoft Windows (with some limited features).

    Additional OSes might be supported in the future.
