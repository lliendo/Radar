Minimum requiremients
=====================

In order to run, Radar needs the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ interpreter (at least
version 2.7) and a few dependencies. These dependencies are already defined
in the project, so you don't need to install them manually.

If you have successfully installed the Python interpreter then is highly
probable that Radar will run without any platform specific issues. Radar does
not depend on any external framework.

Radar (both client and server) should run at least on the following
platforms without problems :

* GNU/Linux.
* FreeBSD.
* NetBSD.
* OpenBSD.
* Microsoft Windows.
* Darwin.
