Introduction
============

    Welcome to Radar ! Radar is a simple and easy to use monitoring
    tool designed with flexibility and extendability in mind.
    It offers arbitrary check execution and server side plugins to
    provide full customization to fit your needs.
    
    It mainly aims to be an easy to use tool, all configuration is handled
    through YAML files and almost all options are set by default for you,
    this means that a typical installation runs out of the box with
    minimum intervention.
    
    What Radar is capable to monitor is really up to you. You can write
    checks in your favourite programming language to monitor anything
    that you're interested in.
    
    Radar has been carefully designed to keep the code clean and
    understandable, so everyone can take a look at its internals.
